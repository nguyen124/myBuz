        <strong>1) GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong>
        <div>1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp; Description. M2Meme is an online platform and social media website that allows users to
            upload and share user-generated content. It is a leading platform for entertainment content with millions of
            daily visitors. As used in this EULA, “<strong>User</strong>” means any user of the Service.</div>
        <div>1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp; Eligibility. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE SERVICE IS NOT FOR PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 13. FOR
            USERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, THE SERVICE IS NOT FOR PERSONS UNDER THE AGE FOR WHICH RULES APPLY ON A
            AGE-BASED BASIS FOR THE COLLECTION OF DATA (“<strong>RESTRICTED AGE</strong>”). IN ALL CASES, THE SERVICE IS
            NOT FOR ANY USERS PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED OR REMOVED FROM THE SERVICE BY M2Meme. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF
            AGE IN THE UNITED STATES OR THE RESTRICTED AGE IN THE TERRITORY WHERE YOU RESIDE, THEN YOU MUST NOT USE OR
            ACCESS THE SERVICE AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER. Furthermore, by using the Service, you affirm that either
            you are at
            least 18 years of age or have been authorized to use the Service by your parent or legal guardian who is at
            least 18 years of age and entered into this EULA on your behalf. If you are using the Service on behalf of
            an entity or organization, then you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity or
            organization to this EULA and you agree to be bound by this EULA on behalf of that entity or organization.
        </div>
        <div>1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp; Changes. As the Service may undergo changes over time, we need the right to modify this
            EULA to match the changing functionalities of the Service. You therefore agree that M2Meme may change this
            EULA at any time without prior notice other than posting an updated EULA to the M2Meme website or within our
            App. M2Meme will endeavor to provide you with prior notice when there are any material changes, and may
            require that you subsequently take an affirmative action acknowledging agreement to the revised EULA before
            continuing to access the Service. You may read a current, effective copy of this EULA at any time at
            <a href="https://m2meme.firebaseapp.com/legal/term-of-services">Term of Services</a>. The revised EULA will
            become effective at the time
            of posting on the Service, and your use of the Service after such time will constitute your acceptance of
            the revised EULA. If any change to this EULA is not acceptable to you, then your sole remedy is to stop
            using the Service. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences of this Section 1.3, no revisions to this EULA
            will apply to any dispute between you and M2Meme that arose prior to the effective date of those revisions.
        </div>
        <div>1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp; Consideration. M2Meme currently provides you with access to the Service for free. In
            return for enjoying this free access, you acknowledge and agree that M2Meme may generate revenues
            (including, by way of example and not limitation, through the sale of advertising and sponsorships, and the
            sublicensing of
            your User Content), increase goodwill or otherwise increase the value of M2Meme from your use of the
            Service,
            and you will have no right to share in any such revenues, goodwill or value whatsoever. M2Meme in its sole
            discretion may eventually charge you fees to access certain features on the Service. M2Meme will provide you
            with advance notice of any such changes before they take effect. Even if we charge you a fee for the use of
            the Service, you will have no right to share in the revenues we charge you or other Users or to share in any
            goodwill or value created.</div>
        <div>1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp; Privacy Policy. Your access to and use of the Service is also subject to M2Meme's Privacy
            Policy located <a href="/legal/policy">here</a>, the terms and conditions of which are incorporated herein
            by reference.</div>
        <div>1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp; Jurisdiction. The Service is controlled and operated by M2Meme from its offices in US.
            M2Meme makes no representation that materials on the Service are appropriate, lawful or available for
            use in any locations other than US. Those who choose to access or use the Service from locations
            outside US, do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and
            to the extent local laws are applicable. Access to the Service from jurisdictions where the content or
            practices of the Service are illegal, unauthorized or penalized is strictly prohibited.</div>
        <div>1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp; Mobile Services. The Service will be accessible via a mobile phone, tablet or other
            wireless device (collectively, “Mobile Services”). Your mobile carrier’s normal messaging, data and other
            rates and fees will apply to your use of the Mobile Services. In addition, downloading, installing or using
            certain Mobile Services may be prohibited or restricted by your mobile carrier, and not all Mobile Services
            may work with all carriers or devices. Therefore, you are solely responsible for checking with your mobile
            carrier to determine if the Mobile Services are available for your mobile device(s), what restrictions, if
            any, may be applicable to your use of the Mobile Services, and how much they will cost you. Nevertheless,
            all use of the Service and the related Mobile Services must be in accordance with this EULA.</div>
        <div>1.8 &nbsp;&nbsp; Additional Terms. M2Meme may require you to agree to additional terms and/or policies that
            it makes available to you from time-to-time in connection with your use of the Service (“<strong>Additional
                Terms</strong>”),
            including the M2Meme Rules. Except as expressly stated otherwise in Additional Terms, such Additional Terms
            are hereby incorporated into and subject to this EULA, and this EULA will control in the event of any
            conflict or inconsistency with the Additional Terms to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency, unless
            such Additional Terms expressly supersede a term in this EULA.</div>
    </div>

        <div>8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp; Respect of Third Party Rights. M2Meme respects the intellectual property of others and
            takes
            the protection of intellectual property very seriously, and M2Meme asks Users to do the same. Infringing
            activity will not be tolerated on or through the Service.
        </div>
        <div>8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp; Repeat Infringer Policy. M2Meme's intellectual property policy is to: (i) remove or
            disable
            access to material that M2Meme believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property owner or
            his
            or her agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the
            Service; and (ii) remove any User Content uploaded to the Service by “repeat infringers.” M2Meme considers a
            “repeat infringer” to be any User that has Posted User Content and for whom M2Meme has received more than
            three takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 512 with respect to such User Content.
            M2Meme has discretion, however, to terminate the Account of any User after receipt of a single notification
            of
            claimed infringement or upon M2Meme's own determination.
        </div>
        <div>8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp; Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement. If you believe that any content made
            available on or through the Service has been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an intellectual
            property right you own or control, then please promptly send a “<strong>Notification of Claimed
                Infringement</strong>”
            containing the following information to the Designated Agent identified below. Your Notification of Claimed
            Infringement may be shared by M2Meme with the User alleged to have infringed a right you own or control, and
            you hereby consent to M2Meme making such disclosure. Your communication must include substantially the
            following:
            <div>a. &nbsp;&nbsp; A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner

                perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
                infringed. </div>
        </div>
        <div>You should consult with your own lawyer and/or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 or other applicable laws to confirm

            effective, a Counter

                disabled;
            </div>
            <div>c. &nbsp;&nbsp; A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that

                removed or disabled; and </div>
            <div>d. &nbsp;&nbsp; The subscriber’s name, address and telephone number, and a statement that the
                subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the

                judicial district in which M2Meme may be found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process
                from the person who provided notification under Section 10.3 above or an agent of such person. </div>
        </div>

        <div>8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp; Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification. If you submit a Counter
            Notification to M2Meme in response to a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then M2Meme will promptly
            provide
            the person who provided the Notification of Claimed Infringement with a copy of your Counter Notification
            and inform that person that M2Meme will replace the removed User Content or cease disabling access to it in
            10
            business days, and M2Meme will replace the removed User Content and cease disabling access to it not less
            than
            10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless M2Meme's
            Designated
            Agent receives notice from the party that submitted the Notification of Claimed Infringement that such
            person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the User from engaging in infringing activity
            relating to the material on M2Meme's system or network.

        <div>8.7 &nbsp;&nbsp; False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications. The United States
            Copyright Act provides that: any person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the
            Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or
            activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including
            costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s
            authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of
            M2Meme relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity
            claimed
            to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.

        <strong>10) INDEMNITY</strong>
        <div>To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the M2Meme Parties
            from and against any claims, actions or demands, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and

            which

            defending M2Meme's interests. In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting
            M2Meme's defense of such matter at your expense.

        <strong>12) GENERAL</strong>
        <div>15.1 &nbsp;&nbsp; Miscellaneous. This EULA is governed by the internal substantive laws of Hong Kong
            without respect to its conflict of laws provisions. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment
            or agency relationship exists between you and M2Meme as a result of this EULA or use of the Service. If any
            provision of this EULA is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of
            such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this EULA, which will remain in
            full force and effect. Failure of M2Meme to act on or enforce any provision of this EULA will not be
            construed
            as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in this EULA. No waiver will be effective against
            M2Meme
            unless made in writing, and no such waiver will be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent
            instance. Except as expressly agreed by M2Meme and you, this EULA constitutes the entire agreement between
            you
            and M2Meme with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous
            agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter herein. The
            Section headings are provided merely for convenience and will not be given any legal import. This EULA will
            inure to the benefit of M2Meme's successors and assigns. You may not assign this EULA or any of the rights
            or
            licenses granted hereunder, directly or indirectly, without the prior express written consent of M2Meme.
            M2Meme
            may assign this EULA, including all its rights hereunder, without restriction.
        </div>
        <div>15.2 &nbsp;&nbsp; Notice Regarding Apple. You acknowledge that this EULA is between you and M2Meme only,
            not
            with Apple, and Apple is not responsible for the App or the content thereof. Apple has no obligation
            whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App. In the event of any
            failure of any App to conform to any applicable warranty, then you may notify Apple and Apple will refund
            the purchase price for the relevant App to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
            Apple has no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App. Apple is not responsible for
            addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the
            App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that any App fails to
            conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer
            protection or similar legislation. Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and
            discharge of any third party claim that any App or your possession and use of any App infringes that third
            party’s intellectual property rights. You agree to comply with any applicable third party terms, when using
            the App. Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this EULA, and upon your
            acceptance of this EULA, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to
            enforce this EULA against you as a third party beneficiary of this EULA. You hereby represent and warrant
            that: (1) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been
            designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (2) you are not listed on any
            U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. If M2Meme provides a translation of the English
            language version of this EULA, then the translation is provided solely for convenience, and the English
            version will prevail.
