                    <strong>1) GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong>
                    <div>1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Description.</strong> TroiViet is an online platform and social media website that allows users to upload and share user-generated content. It is a leading platform for entertainment content. As used in this
                        EULA, “<strong>User</strong>” means any user of the Service.</div>
                    <div>1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Eligibility.</strong> IN THE UNITED STATES, THE SERVICE IS NOT FOR PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 13. FOR USERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, THE SERVICE IS NOT FOR PERSONS UNDER THE AGE FOR WHICH RULES APPLY ON
                        A AGE-BASED BASIS FOR THE COLLECTION OF DATA (“<strong>RESTRICTED AGE</strong>”). IN ALL CASES, THE SERVICE IS NOT FOR ANY USERS PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED OR REMOVED FROM THE SERVICE BY TroiViet. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE IN THE
                        UNITED STATES OR THE RESTRICTED AGE IN THE TERRITORY WHERE YOU RESIDE, THEN YOU MUST NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICE AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER. Furthermore, by using the Service, you affirm that either you are at least 18 years
                        of age or have been authorized to use the Service by your parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years of age and entered into this EULA on your behalf. If you are using the Service on behalf of an entity or organization,
                        then you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity or organization to this EULA and you agree to be bound by this EULA on behalf of that entity or organization.
                    </div>
                    <div>1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Changes.</strong> As the Service may undergo changes over time, we need the right to modify this EULA to match the changing functionalities of the Service. You therefore agree that TroiViet may change this EULA
                        at any time without prior notice other than posting an updated EULA to the TroiViet website. TroiViet will endeavor to provide you with prior notice when there are any material changes, and may require that you subsequently take
                        an affirmative action acknowledging agreement to the revised EULA before continuing to access the Service. You may read a current, effective copy of this EULA at any time at
                        <a href="https://TroiViet.com/legal/term-of-services">Term of Services</a>. The revised EULA will become effective at the time of posting on the Service, and your use of the Service after such time will constitute your acceptance
                        of the revised EULA. If any change to this EULA is not acceptable to you, then your sole remedy is to stop using the Service. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences of this Section 1.3, no revisions to this EULA will apply to
                        any dispute between you and TroiViet that arose prior to the effective date of those revisions.
                    </div>
                    <div>1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Consideration.</strong> TroiViet currently provides you with access to the Service for free. In return for enjoying this free access, you acknowledge and agree that TroiViet may generate revenues (including,
                        by way of example and not limitation, through the sale of advertising and sponsorships, and the sublicensing of your User Content), increase goodwill or otherwise increase the value of TroiViet from your use of the Service, and
                        you will have no right to share in any such revenues, goodwill or value whatsoever. TroiViet in its sole discretion may eventually charge you fees to access certain features on the Service. TroiViet will provide you with advance
                        notice of any such changes before they take effect. Even if we charge you a fee for the use of the Service, you will have no right to share in the revenues we charge you or other Users or to share in any goodwill or value created.</div>

                        Access to the Service from jurisdictions where the content or practices of the Service are illegal, unauthorized or penalized is strictly prohibited.</div>
                    <div>1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong> Mobile Services.</strong> The Service will be accessible via a mobile phone, tablet or other wireless device (collectively, “Mobile Services”). Your mobile carrier’s normal messaging, data and other rates

                        carriers or devices. Therefore, you are solely responsible for checking with your mobile carrier to determine if the Mobile Services are available for your mobile device(s), what restrictions, if any, may be applicable to your
                        use of the Mobile Services, and how much they will cost you. Nevertheless, all use of the Service and the related Mobile Services must be in accordance with this EULA.

                        control in the event of any conflict or inconsistency with the Additional Terms to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency, unless such Additional Terms expressly supersede a term in this EULA.</div>
