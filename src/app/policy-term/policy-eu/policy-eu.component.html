                If you’re a user in the European Union or European Economic Area, please note that Me2Meme Limited is the
                data controller of your information. Here’s additional information we would like you to know:

            <h3>Bases For Using Your Information
            </h3>
            <div>Your country only allows us to use your personal information when certain conditions apply or are met.
                These conditions are called legal bases. At Me2Meme, we rely on one of the following bases:</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contract.</strong> We may use your information because you’ve entered into an agreement with
                    us. For example, when you buy our merchandise and have accepted our Terms and Services, we may use
                    some of your information to collect payment and to make sure you receive the right product, at the
                    right time, to the right address.</li>
                <li> <strong>Legitimate Interest.</strong> We may use your information because we - or a third party -
                    has a legitimate interest. For example, we need to use your information to provide, maintain and
                    improve our services. This includes protecting your account, uploading your posts and comments,
                    providing customer support, and showing the best content you’ll like. Most of these services are
                    free. To keep business alive, we may use this information to show you relevant ads. We
                    believe legitimate interest does not outweigh your right to privacy, so we only rely on legitimate
                    interest when we think the way we are using your data does not significantly impact your privacy.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may ask for your consent to use your information for specific purposes.
                    If we do, we’ll make sure you can revoke your consent in our services or through your device
                    permissions at any time. Even if we’re not relying on consent to use your information, we may ask
                    you for permission to access data such as your location.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal obligation.</strong> We may use your personal information when we are required to
                    comply with the law, such as when we respond to valid legal process or need to take action to
                    protect our users or employees.</li>

            <h3>About Our Privacy Policy</h3>
            <div>
                You have the right to object to our use of your information. For some data, we’ve provided you with the
                ability to delete your data if you don’t want us to store or process it anymore. For other data, you can
                stop our use of your information by disabling the feature altogether. You can do these things on our
                site or in our apps. If you find other types of information you don’t agree with us using, please

            <h3>International Transfers</h3>
            <div>We may collect your personal information from, transfer it to, and process it in the United States and
                other countries outside of where you live. When we share information of EU and EEA users outside the EU
                or EEA, we make sure an adequate transfer mechanism is in place. For internal transfers, we rely on the
                EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield.</div>

            <h3>Your Right To Complain</h3>
            <div>If you’re based in the EU or EEA and have a complaint, you can file your complaint with the supervisory
                authority in your Member States. For example, if you’re based in the UK, you can file a complaint with
                the Information Commissioner’s Office.</div>

                consent as a legal bases for processing your information and your country requires consent from a
                parent, we may require your parent’s consent before we collect and use that information.</div>
