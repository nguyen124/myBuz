Hi Bros thanks for joining me to this adventure. This is the goal of project. We will create a user-generated content like 9GAG https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9GAG . Please feel free to contribute your idea and time. I hope we will go far together. My slogan is "I don't want to code for other people forever so why not try to do some shit". Hope you guys have the same passion.
